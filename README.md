# The-Zebra-Code-Challenge
This is the coding challenge I did for The Zebra. I managed to complete all the basic requirements, and add some styling as well for embellishment. 
For The Zebra's consideration, this repo will become private shortly. 


## Setting Up: 
- The Generator I used: react-webpack-generator

## Starting up:
- npm start
- the app should be on localhost port 8000
